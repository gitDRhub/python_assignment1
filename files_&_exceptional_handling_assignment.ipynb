Instead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly, the pool reuses processes, reducing overhead. It also helps distribute tasks efficiently among available workers, balancing the load and simplifying parallel execution. This is especially useful for handling a large number of tasks with limited system resources."

It is used to overcome the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents true parallelism in multithreaded Python programs. By using separate processes, each with its own memory space, multiprocessing allows Python programs to handle CPU-intensive tasks efficiently and improve performance on multi-core systems."
