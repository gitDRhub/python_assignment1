        "   - **How it works**: Instead of using the entire dataset to compute the gradient (as in standard gradient descent), SGD updates the model parameters using only one random training example at a time. This speeds up training but introduces more noise in the updates.\n",

        "   - This method is useful when the data needs to be within a specific range.\n",

        "   - This method is useful when the data follows a normal distribution or when the model assumes it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Feature Scaling Helps in Machine Learning:\n",
        "1. **Improves Model Performance**:\n",
        "   - Some algorithms (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Descent-based models) are sensitive to the scale of the features. Feature scaling helps these models perform better by ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Speeds Up Convergence**:\n",
        "   - In algorithms like **Gradient Descent**, scaling can speed up convergence. When features have different scales, the optimization process may take longer to converge, as the gradient updates may be uneven for features with large variances.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prevents Bias Towards Certain Features**:\n",
        "   - Features with larger scales can dominate the model’s learning process. Feature scaling ensures that no feature disproportionately influences the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Enables Distance-based Algorithms**:\n",
        "   - For models that depend on calculating distances between data points (like k-NN or clustering algorithms), scaling is crucial. If the features have different ranges, distance calculations may be dominated by features with larger magnitudes, making the results misleading.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Steps for Splitting Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Import the necessary library**:\n",

        "Ans--### What is Data Encoding?\n",
        "**Data encoding** refers to the process of converting categorical (non-numeric) data into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Most machine learning models require numerical input, and therefore, categorical features (such as text or labels) need to be converted into numerical values through encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Data Encoding:\n",
        "1. **Label Encoding**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Converts each category of a feature into a unique integer value.\n",
        "   - **When to Use**: Useful when the categorical feature has an **ordinal relationship**, i.e., the categories have a meaningful order.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For a \"Satisfaction\" feature with categories (\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"), Label Encoding would convert it to:  \n",
        "     \"Low\" -> 0, \"Medium\" -> 1, \"High\" -> 2.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Example data\n",
        "   y = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low']\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Label Encoding\n",
        "   encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
        "   y_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(y)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   print(y_encoded)  # Output: [0 1 2 1 0]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **One-Hot Encoding**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Converts each category of a feature into a new binary feature (0 or 1). Each column represents a category, and a \"1\" is placed in the column corresponding to the category for each observation, while all other columns for that observation are set to \"0\".\n",
        "   - **When to Use**: Suitable for **nominal** categorical variables (i.e., variables without an intrinsic order).\n",
        "   - **Example**: For a \"Color\" feature with categories (\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"), One-Hot Encoding would create three binary columns:  \n",
        "     \"Red\" -> [1, 0, 0], \"Green\" -> [0, 1, 0], \"Blue\" -> [0, 0, 1].\n",

        "   X = np.array([['Red'], ['Green'], ['Blue'], ['Green']])\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # One-Hot Encoding\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Similar to Label Encoding, but with a key difference: the categories are assumed to have a meaningful order (ordinal relationship). This technique is used for features with **ordered** categories, where the order of values matters.\n",
        "   - **When to Use**: When the categorical feature has a natural ordering of the categories.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For a \"Education Level\" feature with categories (\"High School\", \"Bachelor\", \"Master\", \"PhD\"), Ordinal Encoding would assign values:  \n",
        "     \"High School\" -> 0, \"Bachelor\" -> 1, \"Master\" -> 2, \"PhD\" -> 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Binary Encoding**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Combines aspects of both **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**. It first converts categories into integer labels, then the integers are represented as binary code. This method is useful for handling categorical variables with many levels.\n",
        "   - **When to Use**: When the feature has a large number of categories and one-hot encoding would result in too many columns.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For a feature with categories (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"), Label Encoding might first map it to (0, 1, 2, 3), and then binary encoding would represent these as binary numbers:  \n",
        "     0 -> [0, 0], 1 -> [0, 1], 2 -> [1, 0], 3 -> [1, 1].\n",

        "   - **Definition**: Assigns a value to each category based on the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",
